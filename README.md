# BigCrypt
Bcrypt is weak. BigCrypt uses NextGen TimeTech™ to ensure that attackers, hackers, and other LOSERS can't crack any of the hashes produced.

# Usage 
`./BigCrypt.py [file containing plaintext] [Num of iterations (Default 1)]`

# How does it work?

Our NextGen TimeTech™ makes the operation of hashing something take so long that we haven't truly been able to test it. Attackers stand no chance. I hate User Experience and I hate users. I only love SECURITY. If you like security, use this. if you hate security, use anything else. Send me anime recommendations please.
